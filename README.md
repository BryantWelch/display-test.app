# Display Test App

A modern, comprehensive display testing application designed to help users evaluate and diagnose various aspects of their displays. From dead pixels to response time, this tool provides a suite of tests to ensure your display is performing optimally. This is a client-side only application built with React, requiring no backend server.

## Available Tests

- **Dead Pixel Test**: Cycle through color patterns to identify dead, stuck, or subpixel defects
- **Uniformity Test**: Check screen uniformity and identify backlight bleeding or IPS glow
- **Text Clarity Test**: Assess text clarity, sharpness, and font rendering across different sizes
- **Color Gradient Test**: Evaluate smooth color transitions and check for color banding issues
- **Response Time Test**: Measure display motion performance with customizable moving objects and text
- **Color Distance Test**: Evaluate color accuracy and differentiation capabilities
- **Test Patterns Test**: Comprehensive patterns for geometry, convergence, and resolution testing
- **Gamma Test**: Verify gamma calibration and black level performance
- **Viewing Angle Test**: Assess color and contrast shifts at different viewing angles
- **Brightness Test**: Evaluate display brightness levels and consistency
- **Contrast Test**: Measure contrast ratio and black level performance
- **Matrix Test**: See how deep the rabbit hole goes with the iconic digital rain animation

## Usage Guide

### General Tips
- Run tests in a controlled lighting environment
- Clean your display before testing
- Use native resolution when possible
- Disable any auto-brightness or dynamic contrast features

### Keyboard Controls
- `F11`: Exit current test
- `Esc`: Exit current test
- `Space`: Pause/Resume animations (where applicable)
- Arrow keys: Adjust values in certain tests

## Technical Requirements

### Display Settings
- Recommended: Native resolution
- Refresh Rate: Highest supported refresh rate
- Color Depth: Highest supported color depth
- Display scaling: 100%

### Known Limitations
- Web-based testing may not be as precise as hardware solutions
- Results may vary based on browser and system performance
- Some tests may be affected by display scaling settings

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Test appears blurry**
   - Ensure display scaling is set to 100%
   - Use native resolution
   - Disable browser zoom

2. **Animation stuttering**
   - Close other resource-intensive applications
   - Disable browser extensions
   - Enable hardware acceleration

3. **Colors appear incorrect**
   - Disable night light/blue light filters
   - Check color profile settings
   - Disable auto-brightness

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and supported in:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Safari (latest)

## FAQ

### General Questions
**Q: How accurate are these tests?**
A: While web-based tests can't match specialized hardware, they provide a good initial assessment of display performance.

**Q: Should I calibrate my display first?**
A: Basic calibration is recommended for most tests, but some tests specifically help identify calibration issues.

**Q: How often should I test my display?**
A: Regular testing helps track display degradation and identify issues early.

### Technical Questions
**Q: Why do some patterns look different in different browsers?**
A: Browser rendering engines handle color and animation differently. Use Chrome for most consistent results.

**Q: Does screen recording work with these tests?**
A: Screen recording may affect test performance and has not been properly tested.
